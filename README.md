# Aster

**Keep data moving when the network disappears.**

Aster is an offline-first data mesh for applications that cannot depend on a
continuous path to a service. Applications commit data to a local node. Aster
protects it at the source, stores it durably, and exchanges it when an
authenticated contact becomes available.

Direct connections, relays, and central infrastructure can help delivery, but
none is required for the data model to remain correct. Aster is designed for
field teams, vehicles, sensors, and edge systems that move between connected,
constrained, and disconnected operation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Aster is an evaluation-stage reference implementation, not a

## See it work

Start with **Aster Field Notes**. It opens with no processes running, asks you
to choose short-lived nearby discovery or an explicit invitation route, and
lets you add Atlas, Beacon, and Cove, write durable notes, sleep nodes, and wake
them into the same retained mesh:

    mise install
    mise run hello

The display marks an edge only after authenticated contact and marks a note at
a node only after an exact application query finds that Event. Friendly names
stay local to the display and are never discovery metadata. The
[Field Notes quickstart](docs/quickstart/hello.md) explains the ten-second
nearby windows, no-silent-fallback rule, invitation option, and exact
evaluation boundary.

For a deterministic noninteractive two-node path, run the capability tour. It
starts real processes with independent stores and identities, publishes while
disconnected, reconnects over direct Iroh, and verifies an equal-inventory
second pass:

```sh
mise install
mise run tour
```

Continue with the [capability tour](docs/quickstart/capability-tour.md) for the
relay and control variants. Other runnable paths have their own focused guides:

- [trusted-LAN discovery](docs/quickstart/lan-mvp.md) and its
  [flat scale diagnostic](docs/quickstart/lan-scale.md);
- the [hierarchy MVP](docker/hierarchy-mvp/README.md) and
  [hierarchy scale diagnostic](docs/quickstart/hierarchy-scale.md); and
- the interactive [message playground](docs/quickstart/message-playground.md).

## How Aster moves data

    A["Producer application"] -->|"commit locally"| B["Local Aster node"]
    B -->|"when contact exists"| C["Authenticated peer or relay"]
    C -->|"possibly much later"| D["Receiving Aster node"]
    D --> E["Consumer application"]
```

- **Offline publication.** Success means the item is durable locally, not that
  a server happened to be reachable.
- **Store-and-forward delivery.** Protected data can cross several intermittent
  contacts, including relays without content access.
- **Source authentication.** Identity and protected semantic metadata survive
  every hop; carrier identity alone never grants data access.
- **Deterministic convergence.** Nodes reconcile without trusting wall clocks
  or assuming one always-online coordinator.

Read [Core concepts](docs/concepts.md) for the ten-minute mental model.

## Choose a data class

The data class defines how an item converges. It is more than a storage label.

| Class | Best for | Convergence behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **State** | Current position, device status, latest setting | Selects one current value per logical key while retaining meaningful concurrent history |
| **Event** | Messages, observations, audit entries | Preserves immutable publisher order and makes sequence gaps detectable |
| **Record** | Plans, forms, annotations, mutable documents | Preserves concurrent versions for explicit, guarded application resolution |
| **Blob** | Imagery, maps, attachments, large binary objects | Identifies immutable chunked content and supports authenticated streaming |

The [data-class guide](docs/concepts.md#choosing-a-data-class) includes a
decision tree and worked examples.

## Integrate an application

For new integrations, start with the local ConnectRPC agent. It exposes the
live Event authority over Connect, gRPC, and gRPC-Web using a checked-in
Protobuf schema and does not require a hosted Buf Schema Registry.

| Integration | Start here | Current boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **Connect, gRPC, or gRPC-Web** | [ConnectRPC agent](docs/quickstart/connect-agent.md) | Live Event and local status; authenticated loopback process |
| **Command line** | [asterctl](crates/asterctl/README.md) | Node introspection and control through a running agent; `status`, `publish`, `query`, and `subscribe`, text or ProtoJSON |
| **Rust selected node** | [Selected Event API](docs/quickstart/selected-event-api.md) | Live Event publish, query, durable delivery, gaps, and status |
| **State or Record in Rust** | [State](docs/quickstart/selected-state-api.md) and [Record](docs/quickstart/selected-record-api.md) | Cloneable live handles and exclusive stopped facades; direct-Iroh reconciliation; State latest-value and Record conflict-preserving delivery |
| **Blob in Rust** | [Blob](docs/quickstart/selected-blob-api.md) | Cloneable `RunningNode::selected_blobs()` handle for durable file publication, bounded pages, and metadata-only at-least-once publication delivery, plus an exclusive stopped facade; already-durable Blob data can transfer directly under semantic v5 |
| **Rust semantic API** | [Rust quickstart](docs/quickstart/rust.md) | Broader proven semantic surface used as the migration source |
| **Python, Go, or C** | [Language quickstarts](docs/quickstart/README.md) | Offline semantic API through the current C ABI, not the selected live node |

The [application recipes](docs/application-recipes.md) show all four data
classes, queries, subscriptions, batches, deletion, conflicts, and emission
policy. Kubernetes, Zarf, and UDS integrations should treat the ConnectRPC
agent as the application boundary; deployment packaging and protected
provisioning remain open work.

## Current implementation boundary

| Surface | Implemented | Still open |
|---|---|---|
| **Event** | Source-authenticated reconciliation over direct Iroh or one operator-pinned controlled Iroh connectivity relay; live Rust and local ConnectRPC APIs with optional Linux Event TTL and local expiry cleanup; durable consume/carry selectors and at-least-once delivery | Atomic subscription update, production automatic/hosted discovery, public relay selection, and broader physical-network acceptance |
| **State** | Live or stopped publication/query, causal latest-value projection, direct-Iroh reconciliation under explicit interests, and durable positive-current-version delivery | Contact/status, synthetic withdrawals, dynamic network interests, selected-node bindings, finite TTL, relay support, expiry, and garbage collection |
| **Record** | Live or stopped conflict-preserving publication/query, exact-sibling guarded resolution, direct-Iroh reconciliation, and durable whole-key active-head delivery | Selected-node bindings, automatic merge execution, finite TTL, relay support, expiry, and garbage collection |
| **Blob** | Live or stopped immutable publication, bounded authenticated reads, durable metadata-only delivery, and semantic-v5 direct source/range transfer with resumable staging | Peer/convergence status, route-only relay/custody, arbitrary-peer recovery, finite TTL, retention, and garbage collection |
| **Static Event hierarchy** | Profile-`0x0001` authenticated directed edges, topic/priority narrowing, route-only nested wrappers, durable candidates, and semantic-v6 runtime integration | Supported bridge administration, live join/leave, complete quotas, dynamic policy, revocation/rekey lifecycle, and cross-class bridge custody |
| **Security profiles** | Stock hybrid-PQ profile `0x0001`; additive P-256 Event/control profile `0x0002` with an exporter-bound two-node Iroh path | Stock runtime/CLI selection for `0x0002`, general negotiation, complete classical data/lifecycle coverage, and rollback policy |
| **Operations** | Manually admitted direct addresses, one operator-pinned controlled relay, default-off time-windowed mDNS with bounded Aster admission, reference provisioning, and same-UID Unix software zeroization | Protected operational provisioning, hostile-LAN discovery, public/default relay selection, BTLE integration, and physical sanitization |

## Product readiness

The first supportable profile is deliberately narrower than the implemented
surface. Use the [capability roadmap](docs/validation/capability-roadmap.md) for
planning and PR review, and
[requirements status](docs/validation/requirements-status.md) for exact
credited behavior and open gates.

For the Linux Event MVP, [Decision
0043](docs/decisions/0043-authorize-linux-event-mvp-validation.md) records the
team-internal approvals and frozen two-CM4 boundary. The [direct CI-package
device record](docs/validation/evidence/2026-09-15-cm4-ci-package-mvp-validation.md)
records passing direct Event/API and restart behavior in Rust and generated Go,
both instrumented ReceiveOnly identity orderings, clean 1,024-operation
capacity and offline audits, packaged-provider backup/recovery, and strict idle
resource checks on the selected CI package. The directly exercisable bounded
MVP functionality passes on both frozen devices. Protected mission
rotation/revoke/rekey/destruction still requires externally issued authorized
replacement material, and Decision 0043 defers the soak, true-partition,
signing/reproduction, independent-review, and production-authorization work.
This remains engineering evidence, not complete v0.1 release qualification or
production authorization.

The [latest-main package and finite-TTL device
record](docs/validation/evidence/2026-09-17-latest-main-package-ttl-device-validation.md)
adds direct two-node regression evidence for the manually dispatched ARM64
package and the merged TTL expiry, restart, permanent retry-fence, and logical
content-capacity-reuse behavior. The exact package was installed on a third
test CM4, but that unconfigured device has install-integrity evidence only and
does not expand the frozen two-node qualification boundary.

## When Aster fits

Aster is a strong fit when:

- applications must keep publishing without peers or infrastructure online;
- data may cross several intermittent contacts before reaching a consumer;
- links are too constrained to resend an entire dataset;
- conflicts must remain explicit and reproducible without wall-clock ordering;
- relays should forward authorized data without reading it; or
- one application model must survive movement between carriers.

Aster is not a message broker, general-purpose database, VPN, radio manager, or
real-time media transport. If every client can reliably reach one service, a
conventional database or broker will usually be simpler.
